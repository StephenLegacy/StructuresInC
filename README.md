## 🌟 What is a Makefile?
A **Makefile** is a special file used by the `make` build automation tool. It defines a set of rules to execute tasks, such as compiling source code or managing dependencies. It’s especially useful in multi-file projects.

### Example:  
```make
all: hello

hello: hello.o
	gcc -o hello hello.o

hello.o: hello.c
	gcc -c hello.c

clean:
	rm -f *.o hello
.PHONY: animate

animate:
	@echo "Starting animation..."
	@for i in {1..10}; do \
	    echo "Frame $$i"; \
	    echo "🚀 Moving forward..."; \
	    sleep 0.2; \
	done
	@echo "Animation Complete!"
run make
